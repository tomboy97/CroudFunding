# CrowdFunding
CrowFunding is an analogous of the existing well known platform known as Kickstart, but only this has been created by using solidity and ethereum
The purpose of this project is to gain funds for the startups to thrive in the industry.
Any user having a metamask account can create their own campaign or contribute to an already existing campaign.
Through this solidity and ethereum approach this is intended to create a spam user free environment.
Here, the misuse of funds could not take place as, for the client to invest money in various demands of the product, he or she has to get a more than 50% vote of the contributers for finalising his request.
